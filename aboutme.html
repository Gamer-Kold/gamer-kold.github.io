				<p>
					I'm Talha Qamar but you can call me Kodin, 
					a sorceror's apprentice (programmer) from Pakistan.
					I was first introduced to the arcane young at around 6; but I didn't 
					really get into it until I was 8; when I began learning Arduino and
					12 when I began learning Unity Game Engine.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been programming ever since; I like to think that the 
					handful of spells I've picked up ever since have served me well.
					My main experience is with Game Programming both inside and outside
					an engine. Although I suppose I could also say that I'm a web dev now 
					too
				</p>
				<p>
					You can reach me
					<ul>
						<li> On Discord (username is kodin66) </li>
						<li> On Matrix (username is @gamerkold:matrix.org) </li>
						<li> Through Email (qamartalha@proton.me) </li>
					</ul>

					I am currently in the middle of re-setting up my mastodon account
					but when I start posting it will be on @kodin@mastodon.gamedev.place
