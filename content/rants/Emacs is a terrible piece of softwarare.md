Ah beating a dead horse, my favourite way to pass time.

If you are unfamiliar with Emacs, it is a text editor. If you are wondering why people are so passionate about a text editor, you are not familiar with text editors.

I have no problem with Emacs people doing what Emacs people do; but I have had too many try to preach to me and indoctrinate me into the Church Of Emacs. I am not having it. This essay is a list of all my problems with Emacs in one place, so I can send it to anyone and everyone who bothers me about it.

Emacs is a very *versatile* piece of software, I'll give you that. It can do basically anything you want; it can be an email client, a web browser, a git ui, a complete solution for organizing your entire life in a literate programmable spreadsheet. Emacs is a real rabbit hole. There is nothing Emacs can't do, and that is genuinely a point I concede to the Emacs people. But as the old adage goes:

> You were so concerned with whether you could, you didn't stop to consider whether you should. 

But before I absolutely trash Emacs, but I want to go over some things that Emacs has that no editor can possibly hope to match. 

### A first class GUI

I'll say it; Emacs looks pretty. Much prettier than most of what I see on a daily basis in Neovim, Kakoune or even Visual Studio Code. It's just *nice*. You don't need most of the gui niceties when coding. But having inline images render properly and having different font sizes for headings in Org-Mode; it looks good, fantastic even! It really outshines it's competitors in just pure visual eye candy. It also allows for native support for something like statuslines. A scriptable GUI is an Emacs exclusive, and it is one hell of edge.

### A mature plugin ecosystem

### Org-Mode

## And now on to the flaming

### Snailmacs
Emacs is slow; like stupidly slow. I have never used a slower editor. It's slower than Visual Studio. Yeah no not Visual Studio Code. ***Visual Studio***. I tried using Doom Emacs for a week. I couldn't get past a single day. I'm a short-attention span zoomer, I am wired in such a way that if it takes longer than 600ms between me typing and the text appearing on screen; I have a stroke. The near instant feedback of terminal text editors have spoiled me; I require it. It is a necessary point for correct functioning of my biology. I wanna spend time thinking about my code, not my editor
### It's a text editor not a blockbuster AAA video game
### A *terrible* unix citizen
### Buggy as hell
