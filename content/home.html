	<h2>Welcome to Kodin's Tower</h2>

		<em>"Computer Science is a terrible name for this business.
			First of all it's not a science; it might be engineering
			or it might be art.... Computer so-called Science has a 
			lot in common with magic"</em> - Harold Abelson

	<p>
		What can be lost in the neverending march of the software
		disciplines is that it is still quite the unique entry
		in the many endeavours of man.
	</p>
	<p>
		Programming was; and still is a lot like sorcery. We 
		write spells in a precise language that we call
		programs. The programs provide instructions for spirits
		we call processes to perform arcane tasks.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have brought these spirits into every facet of our lives.
		They carry our voices for great distances. They buy and sell
		goods on our behalf. They play games with us.
		They cause great strife and great joy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Through it all, we seem to forget that the monuments we built
		were built with magic. The wisdom of Sorcerors and Sorceresses
		before us; and our own effort on top has brought us here. And
		after us; the young sorcerors will take our wisdom even further.
	</p>
	<p>
		The purpose of this website is not only to advertise myself 
		and my projects (computer related or otherwise) to the world 
		but to serve as a constant personal reminder that the Arcane
		is forever young; and programming will never lose its magic.
