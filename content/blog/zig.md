When somebody asks me what I think about zig I usually have the same response to give these days.

> Zig is (by far) the most interesting technology being developed today

And this is _high_ praise; I recognize that. But this praise is not given lightly.
The more I have used zig the more I am absolutely in love with every decision made by the project;
both technical and managemental related. And I am in love with the community which has echoed the 
philosophy of the project in the best way possible.

# Looking down

> I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around
and just staring at the cloud ... and saying "I want to go there".
But I'm looking at the ground and I want to fix the pothole in front of me
before I fall in. That's the kind of person I am - Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux

We all live in a ivory tower these days. It's easy to think the label only applies
to haskell wizards in their little wizard caves writing a white-paper about 
[the one industry programmer who gives a sh!t](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2010/12/haskell-researchers-announce-discovery.html),
but we all stand upon the shoulders of giants.

As programmers we are more ignorant than ever about the layers of 
abstraction underneath us; This is a feature not a bug. 
No mortal man could look understand the full biblical scale
of the tower we've built. We programmers concern ourselves 
with maybe a couple floors and branches at once; for our own 
sanity. We trust that the giants who built the floors below
us, the ones we depend on, will have built them strong and stable.

This works great! Mostly.

But we must remember friends: The Giants who built those lower
floors were not Giants at all, they were human like you and I, 
standing on the shoulders of Giants greater than them.
And it is the unfortunate reality of life, that all things
built by humans crumble eventually. And it may just be me, 
but I do feel like our foundations have been shaking quite a bit.
