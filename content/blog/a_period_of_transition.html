<p>
	I'm transitioning from useless shut-in to working adult;
	and the transition has brought me much anxiety and excitement.
	That's pretty much the end of my thoughts on that.

	Here's what I've been up to
</p>
<h2>Work on Icecream</h2>
<p>
	I doubt I'm gonna move this website off of hugo anytime soon but there
	are a few pain points that I experience. Namely the templating language.
	More details about it soon but I've started work on Lisp-based SSG
	that I'm tentatively naming Icecream or just Ic for short.
</p>
<p>
	The vision is that rather than using a sort of weird pseudo-language
	you can just use a full fledged programming language to produce your
	pages. With all the flexibility and structure that offers. Not only that
	but a lisp! Which offers even <em>more</em> flexibility and simplicity
</p>
<h2>Work on AbleOS</h2>
<p>
	If I am to be completely honest, I was kind of 
	<a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a>
	into working on this project but I don't really regret it. The project
	is quite unique in a lot of aspects. It's a modern non-POSIX OS; it's
	very much against the grain.
	The original author thinks
	that a usable OS is possible in the future. I say if he keeps up his 
	nerdsniping streak; it's almost a gurantee.
</p>
<p>
	I'm pretty excited about the project as a whole. I'll probably be
	writing about it a whole bunch on here.
</p>
<h2>Work on self-hosting</h2>
<p>
	The dream of every nerd is to eventually have their own server to do
	capital T <em><b>Things</b></em> with them. For me, I'm running out
	of ebook space and I need somewhere to put them. For this purpose,
	"minotaur" has been revived from the dead as "hestia"; the shining 
	light for all my other computer systems.
</p>
<p>
	I plan to actually set it up for use as network share and media server t
	his weekend. I'll write a post here about the process, 
	<em>hopefully</em>.
</p>
<h3>Also Coming Soon-ish to this blog</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Some work on a custom chat client</li>
	<li>A revival of an old dead project</li>
	<li>Some insane ramblings about category theory</li>
</ul>
