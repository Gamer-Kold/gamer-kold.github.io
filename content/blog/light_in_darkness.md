# A Light in Darkness

Written for [32bit cafe's](https://32bit.cafe) new year event.

I think most people who know me would describe me as a cheerful person. It's
always been that way. My current self would agree with them. My past self would
not.

This was on my mind I was getting ready for work today. This felt like one of
the coldest winters in years, though I thought that every year. Despite this, I
heaved myself awake at 5:30 AM. It was late for me. I'm awake at 5:00 normally.

I don't really have a reason for waking up this early. It's a force of habit
more than anything else. I just enjoy being awake early. I enjoy having the
house dark and silent and to myself for just a few hours before everybody else
starts waking up. I love the chill of the early morning air.

Even as a child, I had problems with suicidal ideation. I wouldn't call myself
_suicidal_ at the time, but I did often entertain the thought. But my curiosity
would turn to obsession only in the years of the quarantine. Those years were terrible,
I feel my chest tighten just thinking about what they were like, what they did to me.

I was still a student then, aged 14. And for the first time in my life, I truly hated
my existence. I would wake up everyday study subjects I hated every single day. We 
studied in an auditorium instead of a classroom, so the seats could be spaced 6 feet apart,
and even the tiniest whisper would be amplified by the echo to be deafening. Well I'm exaggerating
ofcourse, but I hated it there, truly. With every fibre of my being. 

I had the pressure of giving my (heavily postponed) first board exams and I _knew_
I was woefully unprepared.
