When we're born, we don't get to pick our names. Some of us have names that
don't really match who we are on the inside, so they pick their own names. But
by and large most of us do just fine with the name that was given to us. I did
just fine with the name I was given too, right up until I joined the internet.

Everybody picks their own name on the internet, for better or for worse. The
first username I can remember picking was "Fallbill" for my kongregate account.
Fallbill didn't stick very long. Like all of my other names to follow,
I picked it on a whim. I was "Tenderdragon" for a bit on some places, my
mother really liked that one, but that one didn't really stick with me either.

Finally in 4th or 5th grade, I was picking a username in a pirated copy of
Minecraft Pocket Edition, and I picked the username that I would use to
this day, "Kold". It's not particularly creative, nor is it particularly
interesting.  Again, it's a name that I picked on a whim. Though unlike the
others, it's not without meaning to me.

As a child, I was very resistant to the cold. Pakistani Winters were mild and
I could usually survive chilly days without a jacket and without shivers. As
a matter of pride and childish machismo, I would wear summer clothes around a
month and a half into winter; until the school would force me to switch. One
of the consequences of this flagrant disregard for temperature and a genetic
predisposition to chilly hands, my hands were always _freezing_ cold. Not
that I would feel it, but others hated shaking hands with me.

I wonder now if it was my relationship with the cold that shaped the name,
or the name that shaped my relationship with the cold. It's too far back to
remember now, perhaps it was a little of both.

Though I don't think the fact that Kold had meaning was the reason it
stuck. It was probably because Kold was infectious. Kold became my email,
my gamer tag, and most importantly for this story: my discord.

Discord was the first time _other_ people called me Kold, instead of just
me calling myself that. Discord has had a huge effect on me growing up,
both positive and negative (but that's a story for another time). So suffice
to say, it very quickly solidified into an _actual_ name. Fallbill lasted
a year at best, Tenderdragon maybe a couple months, Kold has lasted as a
consistent identity for me for the last _8 years_. If you called me on the
street by the name "Kold", I'd probably turn around to look at you.

But around one or two years ago; I started to see a problem with simply
just using "Kold" as my name. It was simply far too common. "Gamer-Kold",
"Teanic_Kold", "Kold66" so on and so forth; while Kold remained a consitent
identity (its what people called me), I ended up taking different names for
all of my accounts, Kold was always taken.

And while it wasn't common, sometimes I'd run into a fan of a more famous
Kold, the League player or the music producer, or maybe straight up just
another Kold. Things got confusing then.

I wanted a name that was unique. So in 2020, I began shopping around and
eventually settled on the name: "Kodin".

It was a bit of an identity crisis in hindsight. And I tried it out for 4
years, and well didn't pan out. There were 3 main problems:

- People still called "Kold" despite having changed my name to Kodin 
- Other recognizable elements of my identity start making less sense (take for example,
"Kool Guy", the smiling white blob with sunglasses that's my avatar everywhere
I go, the pun on his name makes much less sense if my name isn't Kold)
