| There are two main ways to critique a game
|| You can critique it based on how fun it is
||| or how well it tells it's intended message

| Quite often a game succeeds on one of these fronts
|| Titanfall 2 movement sandbox continues to be captivating even if it's story is dumb action movie fun.
|| Presentable Liberty is haunting, has stuck with me for years, but it's gameplay isn't what you call exciting.

| Most often a game succeeds on neither front
|| which makes games like Disco Elysium, who succeed on both, a true rarity.

| Disco Elysium is an interactive narrative game
|| It's main gameplay is making choices
||| It doesn't sound interesting but it is.
|| The twist being is that sometimes the game will require you to pass a check to select certain choices.
||| You roll a digital die and add your stats (the game does it for you behind the scenes) and see if you succeed.
|||| If you don't succeed, sometimes you don't get a chance to retry and you have to roll with the failure.
||||| Other times, you can try again when you level up the relevant stat
||| This makes usually boring game of choosing dialogue options into an interessting game of resource management
|||| You have to carefully decide where you want to specialize, what checks you want to retry, what stats you put your skill points in.
|||| On top of that not all choices are good, completely exhausting a dialogue tree won't do you a lot of good sometimes.
||||| You have to carefully consider your choices

| This incredible dance of stats means that no two stories will be exactly the same, and you can play the game over a lot of times (as indeed I did)

| That's gameplay covered, how's the art?

| There are few games that wear their politics on their sleeves like Disco Elysium does.
|| Instead of using metaphores, Disco Elysium addresses real world problems directly.
|| You may not agree with some of Disco Elysium's views on issues as indeed I didn't
||| But playing through you gain an appreciation of the depth that the game posseses.
||| Plus, ingame you can be any political idealogy you want.
|||| And the game *will* make fun of you for it, even if you have the same idealogies as the game's creators.

| Also Disco Elysium is *hilarious*.
|| I can't tell you any of it, because well, spoilers. But it is damn funny. Trust me here.

| I also won't cover some of the other more universal more personal themes, for the same reason.

| In conclusion, Disco Elysisum is an absolute masterclass is melding gameplay and narrative, and is a must play for anyone interested in video game stories
