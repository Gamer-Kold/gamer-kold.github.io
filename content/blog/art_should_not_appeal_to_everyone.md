I saw some discussion on the old tired "Should From Soft games have an easy
mode?" discourse.  I've actually switched sides a bit on this issue. I used
to agree wholeheartedly but now that I've gathered some experience underneath
my belt, I have a more nuanced take on it.

So if you aren't willing to read the whole thing, here's my take:

I dislike Souls games. They're too hard for me. This is not a personal
failing on my part, but crucially it's also not a failing of the games. They
are _meant_ to be hard, and that decision pushes some people away. I think
that's fine. Not everything is meant to be enjoyed by everybody; stuff that
appeals to everybody tends to be very boring.

I think if you're the sort of person to think that FromSoft games need an 
easy mode, you shouldn't be playing FromSoft games in the first place.
The rest of this blog post is justifying this take.

So before I talk about Dark Souls, let me talk about Dwarf Fortress.

## Dwarf Fortress is really really complicated

Dwarf Fortress is a colony management game, that is you have a bunch of
dwarves and you're tasked with controlling them and making sure they stay
alive by telling them to construct room and board and acquire food. 

To get across how complicated Dwarf Fortress really is let me describe a
game bug.

A player noticed that his tavern was filled with dead cats. Here's what
happened: The dwarves were sitting and drinking when they received an order
from the player.  Because dwarves do not care at all, they simply tossed the
pitchers on the ground, spilling the alcohol everywhere. The cats who were at
the tavern got their paws wet walking, so they ended up licking themselves
clean. The bug being that every lick counted as drinking a full pitcher of
alcohol, so the cats ended up dying of total organ failure as a result of
alcohol poisoning.

Dwarf Fortress is a game with such an intricate simulation that it models
liquid on the ground, limbs being wet, creatures needing to clean those limbs
and the fact that cats cleaning themselves requires injesting the liquid they
are covered in. Let me remind you again that Dwarf Fortress is not a game about
taverns and cats. This is all supplemental, it doesn't mention the economy
or the history, or the individual generated personalities of the Dwarves
and how they can have characters arcs over time. This doesn't talk about
the monsters and the geology or any other of the game's intricate simulations.

To say it is merely complicated is an understatement. But it's precisely that
which makes Dwarf Fortress interesting. Dwarf Fortress would not be interesting
if it was simple and easy to grasp. Not to say that Dwarf Fortress is better 
than the simpler games in its genre but it's _different_ and that difference 
is interesting. 

But that also means that Dwarf Fortress is incredibly difficult to play. The
systems are very obtuse and it lacks a tutorial. It's ascii graphics are 
hard to parse and it's control scheme is completely inscrutable. Learning to
play Dwarf Fortress is a _task_, requiring months of research, and practice
and failure. I never could do it.

But at the end of the tunnel, you get some of the most interesting and 
dynamic stories in gaming. Ones that have never happened to anyone else.
Stories that are yours and yours alone. 

It's not "gatekeeping" that Dwarf Fortress is complex. It's the point.
Not everyone can play it. That's okay. I can't play it. That's okay.
Dwarf Fortress is not my cup of tea, but it's not its fault. It's not
my fault either. Some games are not meant to be enjoyed by everyone.

## But it's critiscm!

If you think that you deeply misunderstand the role of the critic. A critic
does not give feedback to the artist on how best to create the art, the
mistakes the artist made or the things that artist did right.

The role to the critic is to be an informed audience, to feel things as
a result of the art, and to explain why they feel things the way they do.
They serve _the audience_ and not the artist.

That's the difference.

Your critique ended at "I didn't like Dark Souls because it was frustrating".
And this is not an _invalid_ critique by any means. Certainly, there
is large portion of people that would agree with you, myself included.
Your experience with the game is real, whether it was positive or otherwise.
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And by that virtue it _is_ a critique.

On the other hand, "Dark Souls should have an easy mode" is not critiscm,
constructive or otherwise. It's advice, likely from someone with no game
design experience, to people who have been making critically acclaimed games
for literal decades, advice that is completely unsolicited
 and unwarranted because they are, and continue to be, successful without
 it. Do you see the problem?
Do you see why I have a problem with statements like this?

Critique is valuable, advice is not. To paraphrase Bill Hader:

>>> If (the readers) tell you there's a problem, they're right. If they tell
you how to fix it, they're wrong

I can already hear you saying: "So you agree there's a problem?". And well.

## I would love it if FromSoft games were more accessible.

I reference Celeste's assist mode quite often. It's definitely the best
example of an "easy mode" done right. It's off by default, and you have to
go out of your way to enable it. Before you can enable it though, it straight
up talks to the player about what it is and what it isn't

>>> _“Assist Mode allows you to modify the game’s rules to fit your
specific needs. This includes options such as slowing the game speed,
granting yourself invincibility or infinite stamina, and skipping chapters
entirely. Celeste is intended to be a challenging and rewarding experience. If
the default game proves inaccessible to you, we hope that you can still find
that experience with Assist Mode.” -Celeste_

It communicates that _the difficulty is the point_ but still allows you to
make the game easier if it's inaccesible to you. No player playing with Assist
Mode is under any illusions that Assist Mode is the correct or "intended"
way to play. But Assist Mode lets you do complete the game, get all the
trophies , the strawberries, the B-Sides, everthing. Using Assist Mode
doesn't cut off any corners of the game.  Despite this most people play on
the regular difficulty, why? For one it's the default. For two, it's _role_
is clearly shown to the player. This is for people who aren't enjoying the
game anymore. Who are barred for one reason or another from accessing this
game and what it has to offer. Assist Mode give them that extra push.

FromSoft games could do something similar, and I certainly wouldn't be against
it. But, and I will die on this hill, Assist Mode is _not_ an Easy Mode. Far
from it. A difficulty mode is a very bad way of handling this problem. It
doesn't communicate anything and you're supposed to choose what difficulty you
like without even having played the game. It's bad design, plain and simple.

So yeah no easy mode. In my professional opinion that would be bad. But I 
wouldn't be against accessibility options. Despite this, I still think
that _it's fine_ that it doesn't have them.
