I've been using neovim/vim for around 5-6 years at this point. Over time, it's 
turned from a major point of pride to another boring part of my workflow. It
sank into the background so to speak. Though that's just for me. Whenever
people see that I'm using a modal, terminal, text editor in the modern day.

And no, I don't use vim because I want to be fast; I'm a pretty slow coder by
all accounts. But that's what the perception is, the only reason to use vim is 
because you can code fast. I think that sells vim short. So I want to make a case
for vim, a better case.
