| There are two main ways to critique a game
|| You can critique it based on how fun it is
||| or how well it tells it's intended message

| Quite often a game succeeds on one of these fronts
|| Titanfall 2 movement sandbox continues to be captivating even if it's story is dumb action movie fun.
|| Presentable Liberty is haunting, has stuck with me for years, but it's gameplay isn't what you call exciting.

| Most often a game succeeds on neither front
|| which makes games like Disco Elysium, who succeed on both, a true rarity.

| Disco Elysium is an interactive narrative game, one where your "choices" have consequences.
