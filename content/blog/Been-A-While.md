Hi, it's been a bit.

There's probably not a single person reading my blog but it still
feels nice to address the reader like this.

How's it going? Has life been good?

Maybe I'm not talking to the reader but the blog itself. Hm

Anyway.

My button has said "Kodin's Tower" despite the fact
that I've almost completely gone back to "Kold" and "Koldinium".
This has now been rectified, and the new button has a sicknasty
dragon on it (All the other wizards are hella jealous).

Also apparently the previous one was 88x30 instead of 88x31.
I have no idea how that one happened, but it's probably spellcaster
error (i.e. my error).

Do I have any blog posts in the works? Uh, remains to be seen.
Probably not though.

I've come to realize that if the website stays exactly the 
same over the years, that'd probably an accurate representation
of who I am too. I'm not a big fan of tinkering. So I'm trying
to feel less guilty about not updating and stuff.

I'm trying to pick up my daily writing practice again so we'll
see if the blog updates more often.

Till next time.
