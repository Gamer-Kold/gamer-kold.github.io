Ahmed awoke to the sound of a blaring alarm. He hit the snooze button. He
then shut his eyelids tightly and tried to will himself back to sleep. The
wind was blowing now, the sound wouldn't let him.

He begrudgingly dragged himself out of bed, letting loose a singular punch on
the warden of his prison. The alarm clock seemed rather unfazed. He scoffed
and began his daily routine, which was the definition of mundane.

- Checks the weather, wonders who he is reporting to
- Goes outside, notes the red sun
- Examines integrity of the bio-dome

Out of the corner of his eye, Ahmed notices a photo, half-crumpled in
the corner of the maintenance shaft. It's him, with his family, and he's
_laughing_. God how long has it been since he _laughed_? Like, really laughed,
with his belly. He missed the feeling.

- Feeds and cleans animals
- Checks communication
- Repairs communication
- Story ends with dad joke
