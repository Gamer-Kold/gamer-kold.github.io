I'm bleeding out and I don't know what to do.

Earlier this year; I took part in the GMTK Game Jam 2024.  It was good fun,
and I was working some of the most talented people I've ever met. The game
(by my standards atleast) was a huge success.  We reached 101st in the
enjoyment category; people really liked our game!

But even as my team celebrated; I felt a bitter taste in my mouth. And as the
ecstasy of the success faded, I was left with distinctive tang of regret. I
was definitely the one who contributed the least to the final game. Over
the course of the 4 days, a lot of my code was rewritten or reworked and
most of my levels were removed (though a few made it in).

During the playtests, I watched time and again as the parts people got stuck
on were the parts I designed. Again and again, I saw the most bugs propping
up from my code. The thoughts were, _are_, persistent and overwhelming. _Why
didn't I do this better?_ _Why didn't I see that coming?_ _Why couldn't I
just do what I was supposed to do?_

I realize, dear reader, that thoughts like these are illogical. I was the one
who came up with the initial concept of the game; I was the one who brought
the team together. But I am not sated so easily. I still feel like I should
have done _more_, more than I ended up doing, more than what everyone else did.

It's a kind of inferiority complex I suppose. I've always been prone to those.
I'm too prideful to allow myself to be one-upped by someone else, too prideful
to allow myself to admit I have room for improvement, too prideful to allow
myself to rest.

What even is pride really?

I have a vague grasp that it's the fundamental cause of all my anguish;
but not enough to grasp what _it_ is. Was it pride that I was feeling when
my tears fell at 2016's WRO competition in Karachi? Was it pride that I was
feeling when I sat in the fetal position during the worst of the pandemic,
wondering what was the point of living till tomorrow? Is it pride that I
feel now, writing this blog post, trying to understand why I live in constant
war with myself?

I, I, I, Me, Me, Me

I have been talking about myself a lot huh?
Perhaps, that is pride. Perhaps, that is ego.

I, I, I, Me, Me, Me

How does one live without pride? I don't understand. How does one detach ego?
I don't understand. I no longer remember a time when I was without ego;
perhaps I was born this way. I don't know, I don't know. Somehow I feel that 
it has become part of my identity.

I feel, that without pride, I'll shatter.
I feel, that with pride, I'll shatter.

I'm bleeding out, and I don't know what to do. Today was a little better
than yesterday. This year better than the year before. I'm still happy. I
still have friends, family. I'm still good. No need to rush. There's no time
limit. Perhaps tomorrow will be a little better than today, the next year
a little better than this one.
