I've been called an idealist in the past. I think it's an apt title. I often 
strive for and advocate for what even I could call impractical ideals. I could
write a defense for this behaviour, but not today. Today, I'd like to share 
with you an ideal and a dream.

The current world we live in is one of centralized power. Where the reigns
of the digital world lie in very few hands. We rely on the services of Google,
Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook everyday.
