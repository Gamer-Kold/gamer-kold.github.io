This is Kodrants; a website where I rant about anything and everything. I may also post short fiction on here sometimes, thought I might not. Who knows! How exciting!
See what I'm up to right now on the [now page](/now/)

## Who is this and why are you in my computer?

The piece of software you are using is called a web browser and the page you're on is called a website. I only found this out like, yesterday, but apparently computers can connect to each other for the purposes of exchanging information. Wicked right?

As for who I am; I am Talha Qamar, aka "Kodin", and I'm a game developer, and also just regular software developer sometimes. I've been doing it for quite a while now; I hope I'm good at it
