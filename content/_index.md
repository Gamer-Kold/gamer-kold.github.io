## Welcome to Koldinium's Tower

A home for my digital life. A shred of magic in a magical world. A snowflake in
a blizzard. Stay a while and listen, if you so wish.

For those interested in my exploration into the arcane (computers), look no
further than my **[Projects](projects)**

If you want to contact me you can do so through the links I've provided on my
**[About Me](aboutme)**

Sometimes, I write. You can find my writings on my **[Blog](blog)**

If you want to continue further into the independent web, I maintain some
webpages I like; You can find those on my collection **[Links](links)**.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're the sort of fellow (or fellow-ette) that enjoy reading manifestos,
then the following section is for you!

You can read about why I chose the magic and 
fantasy theme for this site **[here](whymagic)**.
