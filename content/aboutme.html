	<p>
		I'm Talha Qamar but you can call me Kold and/or Koldinium, 
		a sorceror's apprentice (programmer) from Pakistan.
		I was first introduced to the arcane young at around 6; but I didn't 
		really get into it until I was 8; when I began learning Arduino and
		12 when I began learning Unity Game Engine.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've been programming ever since; I like to think that the 
		handful of spells I've picked up ever since have served me well.
		My main experience is with Game Programming both inside and outside
		an engine. Although I suppose I could also say that I'm a web dev now 
		too
