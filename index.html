					"Computer Science is a terrible name for this business.
					First of all it's not a science; it might be engineering
					or it might be art....Computer so-called Science has a 
					lot in common with magic" - Harold Abelson
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					What can be lost in the neverending march of the software
					disciplines is that it is still quite the unique entry
					in the many endeavours of man.
			        </p>
				<p>
					Programming was; and still is a lot like sorcery. We 
					write spells in a precise language that we call
					programs. The programs provide instructions for spirits
					we call processes to perform arcane tasks.
			        </p>
				<p>
					We have brought these spirits into every facet of our lives.
					They carry our voices for great distances. They buy and sell
					goods on our behalf. They play games with us.
					They cause great strife and great joy.
			        </p>
				<p>
					Through it all, we seem to forget that the monuments we built
					were built with magic. The wisdom of Sorceror and Sorceresses
					before us; and our own effort on top has brought us here. And
					after us; the young sorcerors will take our wisdom even further.
				</p>
				<p>
					The purpose of this website is not only to advertise myself 
					and my projects (computer related or otherwise) to the world 
					but to serve as a constant personal reminder that the Arcane
					is forever young; and programming will never lose its magic.
