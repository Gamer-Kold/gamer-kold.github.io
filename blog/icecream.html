    <p>So I've been thinking a lot about modern web browsers lately, and they can do quite a lot these days can't they?
    Javascript and web frameworks have made an absurd amount possible. Having an entire programming language built into
    your web browser is certainly powerful. But it's also kind of a nightmare. Web browsers are nightmarish pieces of software.
    They can view videos, images, even pdfs! This is a lot of functionality, more than than that it is a whole lot of 
    <em>unrelated</em> functionality. It's a complete violation of the Unix philosophy.</p>
    <p>But I won't get into that, atleast not yet. What's actually relevant here is that these "modern" websites
    can only really be displayed by "modern" web browsers. Most web browsers of antiquity don't have a whole lot of
    Javascript support. Meaning most of what they can display is static sites, made of pure HTML and CSS. Now this
    may be fine for a pretty minimal website, that never changes. But for most sites (such as a blog for example),
     you need to update pretty frequently. Theoretically it could be possible to represent a site like that in
    pure HTML, but would require so many changes every time you update it, that it would be completely unfeasibile.</p>
